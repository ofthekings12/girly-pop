# Features
**Simplicity at Its Best:** The project keeps things simple, just like the internet fads of the past, presenting users with a single button to begin the experience.

**Chaotic and Provocative Visuals:** Once the user clicks the button, they are immersed in a world of chaotic and spicy, fast-paced visuals, showcasing nostalgic clips from 90's anime and provocative clips from TV and film.

**Upbeat and Playful Music:** The audio experience is powered by the energetic beats of the "Slutpop" album by Kim Petras, who unapologetically embraces the genre. As Kim Petras stated, "People don’t take people seriously — women, especially — who sing slutty songs or songs about sex, and write it off as not being important. I think that’s so stupid… I fully believe that takes as much skill as writing any other kind of song. And so I was like, 'You know what? I make slut pop. And I’m proud of that. And you can suck it if you don’t take me seriously. I don’t care.'" This project celebrates the skill and creativity behind "slut pop" music while challenging societal stereotypes.
